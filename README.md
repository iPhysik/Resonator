# Resonator

The transmission through a resonator symmetrically coupled to both in and output ports is a Lorentzian. The experiemtnal result of a microwave transmssion usually apprears asymmetric due to non-ideal coupling of the resonator to the input and output ports. This is project demonstrate the ability of using rotation method of the transmission on the IQ plane to extract parameters that can bring the assymetric curve into symmetry and be applied to correction for qubit state measurments of a qubit that is coupled to the resonator.
